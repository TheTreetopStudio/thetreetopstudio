# The Treetop Studio
A website for the game development studio The Treetop Studio. Made for Colorado School of Mines Game Development class. 

This is not a true game development studio (or at least a registered one) because this was created for a class. It is a current work in progress and is not the first priority for us. Thanks for stoping by.
